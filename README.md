## Counting Number of Objects using Python-OpenCV

### Prerequisites:

- OpenCV: It is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks.
- Pillow: It is a Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving images.
- Tkinter: It is the standard GUI library for Python.

### Working:

#### Step 1: Importing an image using OpenCV

#### Step 2: Manipulating the image
- Gray Scaling
- Blurring
- Finding out edges
- Calculating the count in the image
- Printing out the result
